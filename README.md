# Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction

"My ridiculous dog is amazing." [sentiment: positive]

With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.

## What am I predicting?
I'm attempting to predict the word or phrase from the tweet that exemplifies the provided sentiment. The word or phrase should include all characters within that span (i.e. including commas, spaces, etc.). The format is as follows:

id,"word or phrase that supports the sentiment"

### For example:
2,"very good"
5,"I am neutral about this"
6,"bad"
8,"if you say so!"
etc.
